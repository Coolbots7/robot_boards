# Motor Controller
Firmware to run on microcontrollers responsible for controlling various types of motors. Receives commands over a communication protocol and controls the speed and or positioning of attached motors.

## Roadmap
* Digital communication protocols - I2C, Serial, CANBUS?
* Brushed motor control - A,B / A,B,PWM + Enable
* Stepper motor control - Step+Direction / Phases + Enable
* Brushless motor control - PWM
* Speed control
* Position control
* Relative encoder closed loop control
* Current monitoring
* Temperature monitoring
* Status LED
* Alarms
* Overcurrent protection
* Overtemperature protection
