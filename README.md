# Robot Boards

This project was created to fill a void between the abundance of breakout boards
for the hobbyist community and industrial automation and robotics equipment.
This project is fully open source and suggestions and contributions are welcome.

## Structure

- `boards/` - Directory containing board designs and firmware.
  - `main_board/` - Board for running operational code and commanding other
    boards. See the [README](./boards/main_board/README.md) for more
    information.
  - `status_light/` - Board for indicating the operational state of the robot.
    See the [README](./boards/status_light/README.md) for more information.
